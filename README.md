# scaffold
### What is it?
Scaffold is the next generation e-learning platform. Imagine if Google Classroom and your school system had a baby; this would be it (but better, of course). It's like Facebook but instead of selfish posts and fake news we have articles of actual knowledge. Basically it's what you want but you won't get (since it's a closed project).

### Who are we?
We are two college students with chronic depression that are undertaking this project as a college assignment. Hopefully by the time you are reading this we have not yet succumbed to hopelessness.
